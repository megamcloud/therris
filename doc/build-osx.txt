MacOS Therrisd BUILD NOTES
===========================
**See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building Therris QT, the graphical user interface.**

**Tested on MacOS Mojave 10.14.2 - Darwin Kernel Version 17.3.0.  PPC is not supported because it's big-endian.**

All of the commands should be executed in Terminal.app (located in /Applications/Utilities)

You need to install XCode with all the options checked so that the compiler and everything is available in /usr not just /Developer. You can get the current version from http://developer.apple.com or by running `xcode-select --install` in terminal

1.  Clone the github tree to get the source code:
    `git clone https://github.com/therriscoin/therriscoin Therris`

2.  Install XCode and it's command line tools (for Homebrew and other compiling functions)
    `xcode-select --install`

3.  Download and install Homebrew using instructions from https://brew.sh/

4.  Install dependencies from Homebrew

    `brew install qt autoconf automake libtool boost@1.59 berkeley-db@4 openssl miniupnpc gmp`

5.  Now you should be able to build Therrisd:
    ```
    cd Therris/src
    make -f makefile.osx
    ```

#### Other Therrisd commands
    Run:
      `./Therrisd --help  # for a list of command-line options.`
    Run
      `./Therrisd -daemon # to start the Therris daemon.`
    Run
      `./Therrisd help # When the daemon is running, to get a list of RPC commands`
